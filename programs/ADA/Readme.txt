1. Implement Recursive Binary search and Linear search and determine the time required
to search an element. Repeat the experiment for different values of n, the number of elements
in the list to be searched and plot a graph of the time taken versus n.

2. Sort a given set of elements using the Heapsort method and determine the time required to
sort the elements. Repeat the experiment for different values of n, the number of elements in
the list to be sorted and plot a graph of the time taken versus n.

3. Sort a given set of elements using Merge sort method and determine the time required to
sort the elements. Repeat the experiment for different values of n, the number of elements in
the list to be sorted and plot a graph of the time taken versus n.

5. Implement 0/1 Knapsack problem using dynamic programming.

6. From a given vertex in a weighted connected graph, find shortest paths to other vertices
using Dijkstra's algorithm.

7. Sort a given set of elements using Quick sort method and determine the time required sort
the elements. Repeat the experiment for different values of n, the number of elements in the
list to be sorted and plot a graph of the time taken versus n.

11. Find a subset of a given set S = {sl,s2,.....,sn} of n positive integers whose sum is equal
to a given positive integer d. For example, if S= {1, 2, 5, 6, 8} and d = 9 there
are two solutions{1,2,6}and{1,8}.A suitable message is to be displayed if the given
problem instance doesn't have a solution.
