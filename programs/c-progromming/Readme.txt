# This folder contains all the programs which are mentioned below.

1. a. Convert degrees into Fahrenheit and vice versa

   b. Calculate the salary of an employee given his basic pay, HRA = 10% of basic pay,
      TA=5% of his basic pay and deductions IT = 2.5% of his basic pay

2. a. Check whether the given number is perfect number
      Defn: A perfect number is a positive integer that is equal to the sum of its proper
            positive divisors, that is, the sum of its positive divisors excluding the number itself.
            Example - The first perfect number is 6, because 1, 2, and 3 are its proper positive
            divisors, and 1 + 2 + 3 = 6.

    b. Solve quadratic equations for the given values of a,b,c.


3. a. Generate all Amstrong numbers upto n.
      Defn: An Armstrong number of three digits is an integer such that the sum of the
            cubes of its digits is equal to the number itself.
            Example - 371 is an Armstrong number, since 3**3 + 7**3 + 1**3 = 371.

  b. Convert a decimal number to a hexadecimal number.


4. Write a menu driven C program to
    a. Insert an element into an array
    b. Delete an element from the array (first occurrence)


5. Write a Menu Driven C Program to
    a. Accept a string from the user
    b. Encode the string.
    c. Decode the string
    Apply the following procedure to encode it.
      1. Convert each character in a string to its ASCI value.
      2. Add an integer value to it and display the encoded string
      3. Decode the string using reverse procedure and display.

6. Write a C program to multiply two matrices that satisfy the constraint of matrix
multiplication

7. Write a C program to find the saddle point of a matrix.
    Defn: Given a RxC Matrix, A, i.e. R rows and C columns we define a Saddle-Point as
          Saddle_Pt (A) for a row I and column j is that A(i,j) that is the minimum of Row i and
          the maximum of Col j.

8. Write a C program to implement a magic square of size n.
    Defn: A magic square is an arrangement of numbers (usually integers) in a square grid,
          where the numbers in each row, and in each column, and the numbers that run diagonally
          in both directions, all add up to the same number.

9. Write a Menu driven C program to
    a. Accept two numbers n and m
    b. Sum of all integers ranging from n to m
    c. Sum of all odd integers ranging from n to m
    d. Sum of all even integers ranging from n to m
      Display an error message if n > m. Create functions for each of the options

10. Write a Menu Driven C Program to implement the following using recursion
    a. Factorial of a number
    b. Fibonacci series

11. Create a structure Complex Number having real and imaginary part as properties. Write
    functions to add and subtract the two complex numbers.

12. Define a structure called student having the properties of student_id, student name and
    branch of the student with a sub structure of marks of 3 subjects. Write a Menu Driven C
    Program to
      a. Add new student detail
      b. Delete a student detail
      c. Display all student details
      d. Display the name of the student with the best mark
      e. Display the name of the student with the worst mark
      f. Display the average marks scored by the students

13. a. Write a C Program to remove all white spaces and newline characters from a file.

    b. Find whether a given word exists in the file. If it exists display the location of the
       word.

14. Write a C program to copy one file content to another file without using inbuilt functions.
